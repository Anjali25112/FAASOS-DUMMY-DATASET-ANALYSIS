## To assess order patterns, delivery performance, and customer behavior for January 2021, with the aim of improving delivery reliability, retention, and peak-time operations.
- What this project is about?
This project analyzes Faasos’ food delivery operations in January 2021 across five major Indian cities (Bangalore, Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi), focusing on order patterns, delivery performance, and customer behavior.

It identifies inefficiencies in order processing, geographic and temporal trends in cancellations, and driver performance variations.

#### Key Findings
- Nearly 29% of orders were cancelled — many before driver assignment or due to long wait times.

- Order volumes peaked during lunch and evening hours, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.

- Bangalore and Mumbai had higher cancellation rates, indicating location-specific challenges.

- Driver performance varied significantly — with clear top and underperformers.

#### Suggested Actions
- Improve order processing and dispatch to reduce wait times.

- Increase driver availability during peak hours; extend weekend hours.

- Run special promotions on Mondays to boost sales.

- Reward high-performing drivers; train underperformers.
